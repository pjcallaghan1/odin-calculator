The Odin Project: Calculator Project <br />
This project will showcase my knowledge with javascript and html to create a functioning calculator. <br />

EDIT: After completing the project I decided to complete the extra credit. This includes the backspace button, decimal button and keyboard support. At the time of editting, everything is fully functional and organized!
